# Receiving an SMS

With Nexmo's SMS API you can receive SMS messages on your virtual numbers.

To receive SMS messages, you need to buy a number and setup a webhook endpoint.

## Buy a number

Log into the Nexmo dashboard and go to [Numbers > Buy numbers](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/buy-numbers). Here you can buy a number with SMS capabilities.

> *Note:* You can also buy numbers with [Nexmo CLI](/tools/cli). Run `nexmo help` to see how.

## Implementing a webhook endpoint

To process incoming SMS messages, we will implement a webhook endpoint
with a lightweight backend framework.

```tabbed_content
source: '_examples/messaging/quickstarts/receiving-an-sms'
```

This will run locally. Your webhook endpoint needs to be accessible on the public internet in order for Nexmo's servers to send messages to you. You can do this easily using a service like [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/).

> Note: The Nexmo API expects a `200 OK` response. The code samples provided already do this.

## Configure the webhook

Go to [Numbers > Your Numbers](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/your-numbers) in the dashboard and press *edit* next to the number you wish to receive SMS on.

Enter the URL for your webhook endpoint, then press update. Nexmo's API will send a request to this address for every SMS that is received.

## Send a message to your number

From your mobile device, send a message to the number you virtual number. The server running your webhook should print a copy of your message to the terminal.

Now that the server works, you can change the behaviour of the webhook endpoint to do something more interesting (respond to messages, store messages in a database) etc.

## Payload

When a message is received on your number you will receive a [GET] request on the specified webhook URL.

Below you can find an example of what to expect in the payload.

````
{
    "msisdn": "447700900000",
    "to": "447700900001",
    "messageId": "0B00000057CC7BC7",
    "text": "Hello world",
    "type": "text",
    "keyword": "HELLO",
    "message-timestamp": "2017-01-01 00:00:00"
}
````

You will actually receive the payload as GET parameters in the URL, not as JSON.
